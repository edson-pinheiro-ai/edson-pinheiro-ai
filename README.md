> I build **secure, evaluated RAG / agentic assistants** for **regulated domains**, with **production-quality engineering** (tracing, MLOps, deployment, and measurable ROI).

---

## What I do

- **ROI-first copilots** (KPIs + baselines) → **narrow agents later** (tight scope, HITL, guardrails)
- **Evaluation & reliability**: groundedness/faithfulness, citation fidelity, regression tests, golden sets
- **Security patterns**: auth-aware retrieval, security trimming, data boundaries, safe failure modes
- **Production engineering**: reproducible pipelines, monitoring, cost/latency controls, incident-friendly logging

---

## Current research

**Self-Verifying RAG for Public Health in Portugal**  
Goal: reduce hallucinations and improve citation fidelity in Portuguese RAG systems via claim/verification protocols, provenance, and strong evaluation.

*(All research prototypes are designed around public/auditable sources and compliance-first thinking.)*

## Featured projects (building in public)

> These repos are designed as a progression: **minimal → enterprise → tools/agents → API → deploy/observe**.

1) **RAG Minimal, but Correct**  
   Docs → retrieve → answer with citations + “I don’t know” behavior  
   - eval harness (golden set + faithfulness/groundedness)
   - tracing to debug retrieval vs generation  
   Repo: _[link soon]_

2) **RAG that behaves in enterprise**  
   Hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword via RRF), metadata filters, **security trimming**  
   Repo: _[link soon]_

3) **Agent with tools (carefully)**  
   Strict tool I/O contracts + validation, loop/time limits, safe failure modes  
   Repo: _[link later]_

4) **Production API wrapper**  
   FastAPI-style schemas, timeouts, structured errors, basic tests  
   Repo: _[link soon]_

5) **Deploy + observe**  
   Deployable service + logging/tracing + cost controls (dashboards later)  
   Repo: _[link soon]_

## How I can help (consulting)

- Architecture review for RAG/agentic systems (security + evaluation + production readiness)
- Build MVP copilots with measurable ROI (baseline → deploy → iterate)
- Add evaluation + tracing to existing systems (so you can ship safely)
- Prepare regulated-domain deployments (guardrails, auditability, provenance)

### Notes
- I don't ship hype. I ship systems that behave well under **tests, constraints, and real users**.
- If you’re working in healthcare: I focus on **auditability, provenance, and safety-by-design**.
